# Orbit

Orbit is a digital audio workstation (DAW), a personal project of mine that I hope to flesh out over time. The main idea behind Orbit is to provide low latency audio creation tools to those without access to expensive hardware, a feature lacking in some modern DAWs.

## Implemented Features

* A mixer track with up to 100 channels.
* Dynamic WAV file parsing & playback.
* Wavetable synthesis.
* WASAPI (Windows) & ASIO driver compatibility.

## Planned features

* MIDI functionality.
* VST & VST3 functionality.
* A fully fleshed out UI.
* Recording & rendering.
* OGG & MP3 compatibility.
